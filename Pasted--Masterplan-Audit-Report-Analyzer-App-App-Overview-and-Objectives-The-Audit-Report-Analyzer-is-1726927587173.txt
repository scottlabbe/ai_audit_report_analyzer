# Masterplan: Audit Report Analyzer App

## App Overview and Objectives
The Audit Report Analyzer is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of analyzing audit reports. It automates the extraction of key information from PDF documents, generates insights, and proposes potential audit objectives using AI technology. The app aims to enhance efficiency and provide valuable insights for professional auditors and related professionals.

## Target Audience
- Professional, experienced legislative auditors
- Other professionals who use audit reports to inform their work

## Core Features and Functionality
1. PDF Upload and Processing
   - Accept PDF files up to 100 pages
   - Parse PDFs using PyPDF

2. AI-Powered Data Extraction and Analysis
   - Utilize GPT-4 mini or similar AI model for:
     - Extracting key information (report title, audit organization, objectives, conclusion, findings, recommendations)
     - Generating insights
     - Proposing potential audit objectives

3. Results Display
   - Present extracted data and AI-generated content in a text-based format

4. Export Functionality
   - Allow users to export results in Markdown format

5. Version Control
   - Maintain multiple versions of reports with the same name
   - Provide option to remove reports from website view while retaining in the database

## High-level Technical Stack Recommendations
1. Backend: Flask (Python web framework)
2. Frontend: React
3. Database: PostgreSQL
4. PDF Processing: PyPDF
5. AI Model: GPT-4 mini or similar
6. Hosting: To be determined based on deployment preferences (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean)

## Conceptual Data Model
- Report
  - id (primary key)
  - file_name
  - upload_date
  - version
  - content (JSON containing extracted and generated data)
    - report_title
    - audit_organization
    - audit_objectives (array)
    - overall_conclusion
    - key_findings (array)
    - recommendations (array)
    - llm_insight
    - potential_audit_objectives (array)

## User Interface Design Principles
- Clean, minimalist design focusing on readability
- Intuitive upload mechanism
- Clear presentation of extracted data and AI-generated insights
- Easy-to-use export functionality

## Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the public tool
- Ensure secure handling and storage of uploaded documents
- Regular security audits and updates

## Development Phases
1. Setup and Basic Functionality
   - Set up development environment
   - Implement PDF upload and basic parsing
   - Create database schema and basic CRUD operations

2. AI Integration and Core Features
   - Integrate AI model for data extraction and analysis
   - Implement the multi-step prompt chain
   - Develop result display functionality

3. User Interface Development
   - Create React-based frontend
   - Implement responsive design

4. Advanced Features and Refinement
   - Develop export functionality
   - Implement version control for reports
   - Optimize AI processing

5. Testing and Deployment
   - Conduct thorough testing (unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance testing)
   - Set up production environment
   - Deploy application

## Potential Challenges and Solutions
1. Challenge: Handling variability in PDF formats
   Solution: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in the parsing process

2. Challenge: Managing AI model costs and response times
   Solution: Implement queuing system for processing reports, consider caching mechanisms for frequently accessed reports

3. Challenge: Ensuring accuracy of AI-extracted information
   Solution: Implement a feedback mechanism for users to report inaccuracies, periodically review and fine-tune the AI model

## Future Expansion Possibilities
1. Support for additional document formats (e.g., Word, plain text)
2. Implementation of data visualization features
3. Creation of a collaborative workspace for auditors to share and discuss insights
4. Integration of machine learning models to identify trends across multiple audit reports
5. Development of a mobile app version for on-the-go access

This masterplan provides a high-level overview and roadmap for the development of your Audit Report Analyzer app. It can serve as a starting point for more detailed planning and implementation.
